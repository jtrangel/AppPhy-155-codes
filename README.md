Undergrad 3rd yr 1st sem 

This semester I worked on implementing and solving several problems using jupyter notebooks. 

Tech stack: Python, Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda

## Module 1

Implements the Fibonacci sequence, plots a deltoid curve, plots a circular helix, determines the underflow and overflow limits for double-precision floating-point numbers, and calculates the sum of two simple series.

## Module 2

Contains the numerical integration of functions using the trapezoidal rule, Simpson's rule, adaptive trapezoidal rule, Romberg integration, and Gaussian quadrature. The results of each were compared and contrasted. These techniques are used for the application of integration to an Anharmonic oscillator. Aside from that, differentiation using central difference is also applied and visualized.

## Module 3

Covers the solution of linear and nonlinear equations. This includes problems on the inverse of a matrix, eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix, and the application of rigid body rotations with matrices to solve for the angular momentum vector. We also have the use of the relaxation method for nonlinear equations, and the calculation of the Lagrange point using both Newton's method and th the Secant method.

## Module 4

Tackles Fourier transforms and its various applications. Includes problems on the Fourier transform of a simple function, Fourier filtering of stock market data, and image deconvolution.

## Module 5

Implements numerical analysis and visualizations of Ordinary Differential Equation problems. Includes Lotka-Volterra equations (predator-prey interactions), the motion of a nonlinear pendulum, and quantum oscillators (wavefunctions and their eigenstates. Initially solved using the 4th order Runge-Kutta method).

## Module 6

Works on partial differential equation problems wherein we focus on the solving the time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation using the Crank-Nicolson method and spectral method. The problem involves an electron in a box, and the solution shows how the wavefunction of the electron evolves over time. An animation is also included, which shows the wavepacket spreading out over time, and eventually bouncing off the boundaries of the box (no quantum tunnelling).

## Module 7

Demonstrates the use of Monte Carlo methods and random processes to approximate the value of integrals and to simulate the behavior of physical systems. Specifically, I worked on the Ising model, which if you check my other github repos, eventually becomes the main topic of my undergraduate thesis :).
