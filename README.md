Undergrad 3rd yr 1st sem 

This semester I worked on implementing and solving several problems using jupyter notebooks. 

Tech stack: Python, Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda

## Module 1

Implements the Fibonacci sequence, plots a deltoid curve, plots a circular helix, determines the underflow and overflow limits for double-precision floating-point numbers, and calculates the sum of two simple series.

## Module 2

Contains the numerical integration of functions using the trapezoidal rule, Simpson's rule, adaptive trapezoidal rule, Romberg integration, and Gaussian quadrature. The results of each were compared and contrasted. These techniques are used for the application of integration to an Anharmonic oscillator. Aside from that, differentiation using central difference is also applied and visualized.
